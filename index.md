## It's an Elm 0.19 upgrade party!

I'll be streaming on November 17th between 9am-noon PST / noon-3pm EST / 5pm-8pm GMT
upgrading some of my own packages, help out viewers with their upgrade questions,
and interviewing and pair programming with special guests!

We'll also have folks available on the [elm-lang slack](https://elmlang.herokuapp.com/) to
help with any problems you encounter while upgrading your own projects.

If you have your own projects to upgrade to Elm 0.19, want to help upgrade community packages,
want to help others out with upgrading, or just want to hang out,
tune in and join us!
